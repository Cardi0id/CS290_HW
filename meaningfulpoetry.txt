One fine day with a woof and a purr
A baby was born and it caused a little stir
No blue bug and no three-eyed frog
Just a feline canine little catdog

Catdog
Catdog
Alone in the world was a little catdog

Out on the road or back in town
All kinds of critters puttin catdog down
Gotta rise above it gotta try to get along
Gotta walk together gotta sing this song

Catdog
Catdog
Alone in the world was a little catdog

Catdog
Caaaaaaatdog
Alone in the world was a little catdog
Alone in the world was a little catdog
